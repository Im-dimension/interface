MILESTONE 2 PLAN: Chiri Sensorial Bridge

Team: Impossible Studio Labs
Track: polkadot maintrack, arkiv main track, Kusama track, SHIP-A-TON
Date: November 2025

📍 WHERE WE ARE NOW

What we built/validated this weekend:

Working prototype of the NFC-to-Arkiv data pipeline

First functional Unique Network NFT that updates its metadata

Verified that Arkiv can store lightweight sensor snapshots

Defined the user story for physical collectibles connected to onchain identities

What's working:

NFC scan → backend → Arkiv storage → NFT metadata refresh

Unique Network NFT structure with dynamic attributes

Smooth Arkiv SDK integration for reading/writing

What still needs work:

Real time syncing

Frontend UI for collectors

UX flow for linking physical object to wallet

Blockers or hurdles we hit:

SDK inconsistencies between Arkiv versions

Time constraints for polishing the user dashboard

Need more guidance on Polkadot Asset Hub compatibility

🚀 WHAT WE'LL SHIP IN 30 DAYS

Our MVP will do this:
Chiri Sensorial Bridge allows a physical collectible with an embedded NFC chip to sync “story events” and micro sensor data into an Arkiv data stream, which automatically updates a dynamic NFT on Unique Network. It gives creators and collectors a verifiable identity layer for hybrid physical digital items.

Features We'll Build (3-5 max)
Week 1-2

Feature: Collector onboarding + object linking flow
Why it matters: Users need a seamless way to attach their physical object to their wallet
Who builds it: Product + Dev (Laz & Partner)

Feature: Arkiv data schema v1 for physical objects
Why it matters: Defines how events, snapshots, and tags are stored long term
Who builds it: Backend Dev

Week 2-3

Feature: Dynamic NFT updater (automatic metadata refresh)
Why it matters: This is the core value of the project: objects that "evolve" onchain
Who builds it: Blockchain Dev

Feature: Simple collector dashboard
Why it matters: Users need to see their object’s evolving digital state
Who builds it: Frontend Dev

Week 3-4

Feature: NFC event triggers mapped to Arkiv actions
Why it matters: Physical world → digital world bridge becomes fully functional
Who builds it: Dev + Product

Feature: Kusama art experiment extension (optional bounty)
Why it matters: Expands the narrative layer and allows art events to be stored as “interaction rituals”
Who builds it: Creative + Dev

🧠 Mentoring & Expertise We Need

Areas where we need support:

Best practices for long term data structuring with Arkiv

Guidance on storage cost optimization in Polkadot ecosystem

Specific expertise we're looking for:

Unique Network dynamic NFT patterns

NFC security + anti cloning approaches

🎯 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

When M2 is done, we plan to…

Release the first limited edition of Chiri NFC collectibles

Launch the beta of the collector dashboard

Prepare the integration with Decentraland and metaverse identity flows

Open the project as a reusable template for artists and makers in Polkadot

And 6 months out we see our project achieve:

A fully working creator toolkit for physical digital objects

A marketplace ready for evolving NFTs

Integration with multi chain metaverses

A community of artists using this framework to build hybrid collectibles
